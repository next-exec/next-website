    Next Act is our annual, student-run musical. Every year, we transform our
    huge tastefully furnished lounge (TFL) on the first floor into an awesome
    theater, and put on a great show for CPW. Everyone in the show - including
    the actors, actresses, prod staff, and pit orchestra - are students from
    Next and all around campus. There's a wide range of experience levels, too
    - for some it's their first time being in a show, while others have been
    in so many shows it's hard to keep count! Next Act is open to everyone,
    and it's sure to be a lot of fun.
